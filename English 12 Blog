    <p>Toxic masculinity refers to harmful behaviors and attitudes associated with traditional cultural expectations of what it means to be a man. These expectations often involve the suppression of emotions, the glorification of violence, and a belief in male dominance and entitlement. Toxic masculinity can lead to a wide range of negative consequences for both men and women, including gender-based violence, mental health issues, and social and economic inequality.

In today's society, there is growing recognition of the harm caused by toxic masculinity and efforts to promote healthier, more inclusive models of masculinity. This includes promoting emotional intelligence and vulnerability, rejecting violence and aggression as norms of masculinity, and advocating for greater gender equality and social justice. Such efforts are important for building a more equitable and just society, where all individuals are free to express their full humanity and potential. 
Such Toxicity can be seen within Stanley from A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams. In Scene 1 he tooks of shirt infront of his sister in law,My clothes re stickin to me. Do you mind if I make myself comfortable?'(Williams,23).This demonstrates a lack of respect for women and an inclination to view them solely as sexual objects. This can be seen as a form of seduction by many. But Stanley might be unaware of actions, he might think that him taking of his top is okay. So, he is a toxic men unaware of his doings.
